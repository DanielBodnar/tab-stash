# Tab Stash Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported (regardless of distribution channel).
Supported distribution channels include:

- The official listing on [addons.mozilla.org][amo].

- Re-packaged/re-distributed copies of the latest version are supported, so long
  as they are not patched and were built following the "release version" build
  instructions in the README file.

[amo]: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-stash/

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities may be reported in confidence via email to
`tab-stash@condordes.net`. Please put `[Tab Stash Security]` (including the
brackets) at the beginning of the subject.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible, and
include steps to reproduce the issue (just as if you were filing a normal bug
report).

Please note that because Tab Stash is a spare-time/"for fun" project:

- I cannot promise a fix by any particular time, though I will strive to address
  any confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.

- I do not offer bug bounties or rewards/fees/etc. of any kind (other than my
  sincere thanks).
