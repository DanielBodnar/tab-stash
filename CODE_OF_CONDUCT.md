# Tab Stash Code of Conduct

Tab Stash has adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][conduct].
Anyone participating in the Tab Stash community, whether they are writing code,
filing bugs, or simply posting questions, is asked to follow these standards.

[conduct]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/

In short, before posting please ask yourself: "If this were directed at me, how
would it make me feel?" If the answer is negative, think carefully about how to
re-frame your post---try to focus on specific, observable facts, avoid
generalizing, and replace emotional language ("this was a huge problem") with
concrete details ("it took me an hour to recover my data because...").

Any concerns may be reported privately by email to `tab-stash@condordes.net`.
Please put `[Tab Stash Conduct]` (including the brackets) at the beginning of
the subject.
