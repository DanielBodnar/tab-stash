    <Version v="NEXT">
      <L v="Added">the ability to manage collapsed groups in the sidebar.  When
        you hover over a collapsed group, the group's "Stash..." and "Open..."
        buttons will now appear.</L>
      <L :issue="8" v="Fixed">a poor interaction between Tab Stash and Firefox
        Sync that would occasionally cause stashed tabs to get mis-filed so they
        no longer appear in the stash.  To recover any missing tabs, see:</L>
    </Version>

    <Version v="2.2.1">
      <L subtext="Fun fact: This bug was caused by a single-letter typo."
         v="Fixed">an issue preventing Tab Stash from closing hidden tabs
        associated with bookmarks that were deleted from the stash.</L>

        empty folders in the stash.</L>
      <L :issue="4"
         subtext="This bug was caused by a whole WORD being wrong."
         v="Fixed">an issue where the option to close instead of hide stashed
        tabs wasn't being respected.</L>
      <L subtext="(Imagine the chaos if it had been an entire line of code.)"
        v="Fixed">an issue that in some cases would cause the stash list to

      <L :subtext="`I kept collapsing groups, forgetting they were collapsed, `
                   + `and then wondering where all my tabs went.  Now I `
                   + `knowâ€”they were lost at sea in the Disclosure Triangle.`"
         v="Improved"> the styling of collapsed groups in the tab view, to make
        them more visually-distinct from folders that are not collapsed.</L>
      <L v="Fixed">a conflict with keyboard shortcuts on Windows and Linux.  The
        new keyboard shortcuts are as follows:</L>
      <ul>
        <li>Show stashed tabs in sidebar: <em>Ctrl+Alt+S</em></li>
        <li>Stash all open tabs: <em>Ctrl+Alt+T</em></li>
        <li>Stash the active tab: <em>Ctrl+Alt+W</em></li>
      </ul>
      <L subtext="So narrow you couldn't park a motorcycle in it." v="Fixed">

        stashing tabs.</L>
