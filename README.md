# Tab Stash

Can't keep all your open tabs straight?  Need to clear your plate, but want to
come back to your tabs later?

Tab Stash is a no-fuss way to save, restore and organize batches of tabs as
bookmarks.  With one click on the Tab Stash icon, you can sweep your browser
window clear of tabs, and save them all into the "Tab Stash" sidebar or tab,
organized conveniently into groups.  Then, when it's time to go back to that
research project, just pop open your stash and restore the whole group, or
restore only that one tab you were interested in.
