# Tab Stash

Can't keep all your tabs straight? Need to clear your plate, but want to come
back to your tabs later?

Tab Stash is a no-fuss way to save and organize batches of tabs as bookmarks.
Sweep your browser clean with one click of the Tab Stash icon. Your open tabs
will be stashed away in your bookmarks, conveniently organized into groups.
When it's time to pick up where you left off, open Tab Stash and restore just
the tabs or groups you want.

Because Tab Stash stores your tabs as bookmarks, they will even sync to your
other computers or mobile devices. Uses Firefox Sync, if configured---no need
to keep track of yet another account.
